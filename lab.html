        <p>
          The <strong>Secure Software Systems Lab (S³ Lab)</strong> conducts research at the intersection of software engineering and cybersecurity. 
          Our work focuses on improving security across the software lifecycle — from early-stage design and requirements engineering 
          to post-deployment vulnerability management.
        </p>
        <p>
          We combine formal methods, machine learning, and empirical software analysis to:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>Automate the detection and reasoning of security weaknesses in requirements and code,</li>
          <li>Evaluate and improve vulnerability scoring and prioritization systems, and</li>
          <li>Develop tools that make secure-by-design practices more practical and scalable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our goal is to advance both the science and practice of building secure, trustworthy software systems.

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Data-Driven Vulnerability Management and Risk Prioritization</h3>
          <p>
            Our group investigates how organizations assess and prioritize software vulnerabilities in practice and how these processes can be improved 
            through data-driven methods. We study the strengths and limitations of existing scoring systems and analyze how well these metrics align with 
            each other and with real-world exploitation trends. Building on our recent empirical studies, we are developing metrics and models that combine 
            statistical analysis and machine learning to provide more accurate, context-aware vulnerability prioritization. 
            Students involved in this project can explore vulnerability datasets, perform correlation and predictive analyses, and contribute to the 
            design of next-generation risk assessment tools that better support security decision-making.

        <!-- Project 2 -->
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-2">Detecting Security Weaknesses in Software Requirements and Early Design</h3>
          <p>
            This project focuses on improving software security at its foundation: the early requirements and design stages. 
            We are building automated methods to detect and explain potential security weaknesses in natural-language requirements even before code is written. 
            Our work integrates machine learning (ML) with formal reasoning to translate informal requirements into analyzable specifications and 
            identify design-level flaws such as missing access controls or weak authentication mechanisms. 
            Building on our published research in secure requirements engineering, this ongoing effort aims to create practical tools that help developers 
            and analysts reason about security early in the software lifecycle. 
            Students involved in this project can gain hands-on experience with formal modeling, ML, and empirical evaluation of AI-assisted security tools.
